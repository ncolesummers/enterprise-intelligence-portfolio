Okay, I will start by analyzing `src/app/projects/myui/page.tsx`. Since it's a large file (632 lines), I'll read it in parts.

First, I'll read the first 250 lines.

Read file: src/app/projects/myui/page.tsx
Okay, I've reviewed the first 250 lines of `src/app/projects/myui/page.tsx`.

**Initial Observations:**

1.  **Component Size:** The `MyUIPage` component renders a significant amount of static content describing the MyUI project. This contributes to its large size.
2.  **Structure:** The page is well-structured into logical sections (`Introduction`, `Project Overview`, `Key Features`, etc.) using semantic HTML (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`).
3.  **Styling:** Tailwind CSS is used consistently for styling.
4.  **Repetition:**
    *   Each section follows a similar layout pattern (heading + divider + content).
    *   Lists within sections use a consistent style (`<li className="flex items-start"><span className="mr-2 text-primary">•</span> ... </li>`).
5.  **Inline SVG:** An SVG icon is defined directly within the JSX for the "Visit MyUI" button (lines 32-39).

Now, I'll read the next 250 lines (251-500) to get a more complete picture.

Okay, I have reviewed the rest of `src/app/projects/myui/page.tsx`.

**Analysis of `src/app/projects/myui/page.tsx` (632 lines):**

*   **Large Component:** The primary issue is that the entire page is rendered by a single, very large component (`MyUIPage`). This component contains a lot of static text and repeated structural patterns. Large components are harder to read, test, and maintain.
*   **Duplication:**
    *   **Section Headers:** The structure for section headers (H2 tag + horizontal line) is repeated multiple times (e.g., lines 54-57, 91-94, 137-140).
    *   **List Items:** The styling for bullet points (`<li className="flex items-start"><span className="mr-2 text-primary\">•</span>...`) is used repeatedly in different sections (e.g., lines 73-88, 193-211, 221-236, etc.).
    *   **Buttons:** The "Visit MyUI" button, including its inline SVG icon, appears twice (lines 28-43 and 594-609).
*   **Inline SVG:** The play icon SVG is defined directly within the JSX in two places. Extracting this into its own component would improve reusability and readability.
*   **Static Content:** The component is primarily responsible for rendering large amounts of static, descriptive text about the MyUI project.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Component Decomposition:** Break down the `MyUIPage` component into smaller, more focused components. Each major section (`Hero`, `Introduction`, `Project Overview`, `Key Features`, `My Role`, `Benefits`, `Technical Implementation`, `Ethos Integration`, `Results`, `Conclusion`, `CallToAction`) should ideally be its own component.
2.  **Reusable Components:**
    *   Create a `SectionHeader` component that takes the title as a prop to avoid repeating the header structure.
    *   Create a `ListItem` or `BulletPoint` component for the consistent list item styling.
    *   Extract the inline SVG into a dedicated `PlayIcon` component and reuse it in the buttons.
3.  **(Optional) Data Separation:** Consider moving the static text content (descriptions, lists, etc.) into a separate data structure (like a JSON object) and passing it down as props to the section components. This separates the content from the presentation logic, making the main component cleaner and the text easier to update if needed.

Okay, I will now analyze `src/app/projects/profile-extractor/page.tsx`. It's 602 lines long, so I'll read it in parts again.

First, I'll read lines 1-250.

Read file: src/app/projects/profile-extractor/page.tsx
Okay, I've reviewed the first 250 lines of `src/app/projects/profile-extractor/page.tsx`.

**Initial Observations:**

1.  **Similar Structure:** This page component (`ProfileExtractorPage`) shares a very similar overall structure and styling with `MyUIPage`. It has the same sticky header, section-based layout, and uses Tailwind CSS.
2.  **Component Size:** Like `MyUIPage`, this component renders a significant amount of static content describing the AI Data Extraction Research project.
3.  **Repetition:**
    *   The section header pattern (H2 tag + horizontal line) is repeated (lines 29-32, 65-68, 106-109, 188-191).
    *   The bulleted list item style is reused (lines 48-61, 163-177, 181-185, 237-248).
4.  **Code Snippets:** The file includes code snippets (Pydantic schemas, Gemini model initialization) formatted using `<pre><code>` tags (starting around line 201). Embedding large code blocks directly can make the component less readable.

Now, I'll read the next 250 lines (251-500).

Read file: src/app/projects/profile-extractor/page.tsx
Now I'll read the final part, lines 501-602.

Read file: src/app/projects/profile-extractor/page.tsx
Okay, I have finished reviewing `src/app/projects/profile-extractor/page.tsx`.

**Analysis of `src/app/projects/profile-extractor/page.tsx` (602 lines):**

*   **Large Component:** Similar to `myui/page.tsx`, this file defines a single, large component (`ProfileExtractorPage`) responsible for rendering the entire page content. This makes the component complex and harder to manage.
*   **Structural Similarity:** It shares the same basic layout, header, and section-based structure as `myui/page.tsx`.
*   **Duplication:**
    *   **Section Headers:** The H2 title + divider pattern is repeated for each section.
    *   **List Items:** The styling for both bulleted (`ul`) and numbered (`ol`) lists is repeated.
    *   **Content Cards:** The `rounded-lg bg-gray-800 p-6` card structure is used extensively.
    *   **Code Block Styling:** The `<pre><code>` structure with specific styling is used multiple times for displaying code snippets.
*   **Inline Code Snippets:** Python code snippets (Pydantic models, Gemini config) are embedded directly as strings within the JSX (e.g., lines 204-227, 271-292). This makes the component verbose.
*   **Inline SVG:** A circular progress bar SVG is defined inline within the "Results" section (lines 366-379).

**Recommendations:**

The recommendations are very similar to those for `myui/page.tsx` due to the similar structure and issues:

1.  **Component Decomposition:** Break `ProfileExtractorPage` into smaller components based on sections (e.g., `IntroductionSection`, `MethodologySection`, `ResultsSection`, etc.).
2.  **Reusable Components:**
    *   Create shared components for `SectionHeader`, `ListItem` (or variants), and `ContentCard`.
    *   Create a `CodeBlock` component to handle the display and styling of code snippets, taking the code string as a prop.
    *   Extract the inline SVG into a `CircularProgressBar` component.
    *   Consider a `StatDisplay` component for the visual elements in the "Results" section (Accuracy, Cost, Performance).
3.  **(Optional) Data Separation:** Move the static text content and code snippet strings into a separate data structure if desired, passing them as props.

Shall I proceed to analyze the next file, `src/app/projects/mikrotik-config-gen/page.tsx`?

Okay, let's analyze `src/app/projects/mikrotik-config-gen/page.tsx`. It has 418 lines, so I'll read it in parts.

Starting with lines 1-250.

Read file: src/app/projects/mikrotik-config-gen/page.tsx
Okay, I've read the first 250 lines of `src/app/projects/mikrotik-config-gen/page.tsx`.

**Initial Observations:**

1.  **Consistent Structure:** This page (`MikrotikConfigGenPage`) follows the exact same structural pattern as the previous two project pages (`MyUIPage` and `ProfileExtractorPage`) - sticky header, section-based layout with title+divider, Tailwind styling, and a call to action at the end.
2.  **Component Size:** It's smaller than the previous two (418 lines) but still renders a lot of static content describing the Mikrotik Config Generator project.
3.  **Repetition:**
    *   Section headers (lines 57-60, 96-99, 132-135, 175-178, 241-244).
    *   Bulleted list item style (lines 76-91, 162-171, 201-209, 228-236).
    *   Content cards (`rounded-lg bg-gray-800 p-6`).
    *   Code snippets using `<pre><code>` (starting around line 212).
4.  **Inline SVG:** An "upload" icon SVG is defined inline in the "View Presentation" button (lines 27-48).
5.  **Inline Code Snippets:** Like the previous file, it includes Python and Go code snippets embedded as strings.

Now, I'll read the rest of the file (lines 251-418).

Read file: src/app/projects/mikrotik-config-gen/page.tsx
I have now reviewed all of `src/app/projects/mikrotik-config-gen/page.tsx`.

**Analysis of `src/app/projects/mikrotik-config-gen/page.tsx` (418 lines):**

*   **Large Component & Duplication:** This file suffers from the same issues as the previous two project pages: it's a single large component (`MikrotikConfigGenPage`) with significant duplication of structure and styling (section headers, list items, content cards, code block styling, button styling).
*   **Inline SVG:** The "View Presentation" button with its inline SVG icon is duplicated (lines 23-50 and 385-411).
*   **Inline Code Snippets:** Python and Go code snippets are embedded as strings.

**Recommendations:**

The recommendations are consistent with the previous project pages:

1.  **Component Decomposition:** Break `MikrotikConfigGenPage` into smaller components based on sections.
2.  **Reusable Components:**
    *   Utilize shared components for `SectionHeader`, `ListItem`, `ContentCard`, `CodeBlock`.
    *   Extract the inline "upload" SVG into an `UploadIcon` component and reuse it in the buttons.

**Overall Observation (Project Pages):**

All three project pages (`myui/page.tsx`, `profile-extractor/page.tsx`, `mikrotik-config-gen/page.tsx`) share a nearly identical structure and suffer from the same problems: large component size and significant code duplication. Creating shared layout and UI components would drastically reduce the code size and improve maintainability for these pages.

Next, I'll analyze `src/app/about/page.tsx` (301 lines). Since it's smaller, I'll read the whole file at once.

Read file: src/app/about/page.tsx
Okay, I have reviewed `src/app/about/page.tsx`.

**Analysis of `src/app/about/page.tsx` (301 lines):**

*   **Component Size:** This component (`AboutPage`) is moderately sized. While still containing static content, it's less extensive than the project pages.
*   **Layout:** It uses a similar section-based layout with headers and dividers, but the overall structure is simpler than the project pages.
*   **Header & Footer:** This page includes a different header (with navigation links) and a footer with social media links.
*   **Duplication:**
    *   **Header/Footer Links:** The social media links (`Linkedin`, `Github`, `Instagram`) are present in both the header (lines 18-30) and the footer (lines 280-294), represented slightly differently (icon buttons in header, icons-only in footer). The "Contact me" button in the header (lines 31-33) links to the same email as the "Email" button in the hero section (lines 67-75).
    *   **Section Headers:** The H2 title + divider pattern is reused (lines 79-82, 148-151, 193-196).
    *   **List Styles:** Different list styles are used (bullet points with dots in "Technical Expertise", bullet points with `•` in "Certifications", icon-based cards in "Beyond the Code"). Some repetition exists within these styles.
    *   **Content Cards:** The `rounded-lg bg-gray-800 p-6` card structure is used again.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Component Decomposition:** While not as critical as the project pages, breaking down sections (`ProfessionalJourney`, `Philosophy`, `PersonalInterests`) into separate components could still improve organization.
2.  **Reusable Components:**
    *   Use the shared `SectionHeader` component.
    *   Create reusable components for the different list styles seen (`TechExpertiseList`, `CertificationList`, `InterestCard`).
    *   Refactor the social media links in the header and footer. Potentially create a `SocialLinks` component that can be styled differently based on where it's used (header vs. footer) to avoid repeating the links and icons.
    *   Consider abstracting the different button styles used (outline with icon, ghost icon, solid white) into reusable variations if they appear frequently elsewhere.
3.  **(Potential) Layout Component:** Since the header and footer structure might be reused on other top-level pages (like the main portfolio page), consider creating a `MainLayout` component that wraps the page content and includes the common header/footer structure.

Next, I will analyze `src/app/page.tsx` (176 lines).

Read file: src/app/page.tsx
Okay, I have reviewed `src/app/page.tsx`.

**Analysis of `src/app/page.tsx` (176 lines):**

*   **Component Size:** This main page component (`Page`) is reasonably sized.
*   **Structure:** It uses a standard layout with a `<header>`, `<main>` (containing sections), and `<footer>`.
*   **Header & Footer:** The header and footer structures are identical to the ones used in `src/app/about/page.tsx`. This confirms the opportunity to create a reusable `MainLayout` component.
*   **Internal Component:** The `ProjectCard` component is defined within the same file (lines 141-174). This is generally acceptable for small, page-specific components, but if `ProjectCard` were to be used elsewhere, it should be moved to its own file in the `components` directory.
*   **Duplication:**
    *   **Header/Footer:** As noted, the header/footer code is duplicated from `about/page.tsx`.
    *   **Contact Button:** The "Contact me" button appears twice (lines 39-41 and 114-116).
    *   **Social Links:** The social media links are duplicated in the header and footer.
*   **Inline Scroll Logic:** The "Work" navigation button uses an inline `onClick` handler with `document.getElementById` and `scrollIntoView` (lines 17-22) for smooth scrolling. While functional, this mixes presentation logic with direct DOM manipulation. A more React-idiomatic approach (e.g., using refs or a library) might be preferable, especially if this pattern were reused.
*   **Hardcoded Project Data:** The data for the `ProjectCard` components (title, description, link) is hardcoded directly in the JSX (lines 81-105).

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Layout Component:** Create a `MainLayout` component that includes the common `<header>` and `<footer>` structure used here and in `about/page.tsx`. This layout component would accept the page content as children.
2.  **Refactor Header/Footer:** Extract the header and footer content into their own components (`AppHeader`, `AppFooter`) to be used within the `MainLayout`. Refactor the duplicated social links and contact button logic within these components.
3.  **Project Card Location:** Decide if `ProjectCard` will be reused. If so, move it to `src/components/project-card.tsx` (or similar). If not, leaving it here is acceptable.
4.  **Data Separation:** Move the array of project data (titles, descriptions, links) into a constant array outside the component definition. Then, map over this array to render the `ProjectCard` components dynamically. This makes the main component cleaner and the project list easier to manage.
    ```typescript
    const projects = [
      { title: "University of Idaho Website", description: "...", comingSoon: true },
      { title: "AI Data Extraction Research", description: "...", link: "/projects/profile-extractor", hasCase: true },
      // ... other projects
    ];

    // Inside the component:
    {projects.map(project => (
      <ProjectCard key={project.title} {...project} />
    ))}
    ```
5.  **Smooth Scrolling:** Consider using React refs for the smooth scrolling behavior instead of direct `getElementById`.

We have now analyzed the larger page components. Shall we move on to the smaller UI components and utility files?
