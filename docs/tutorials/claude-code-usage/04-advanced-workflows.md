# Advanced Workflows

Master complex automation patterns and enterprise-scale development workflows with Claude Code.

## Multi-Role Workflows

Combine multiple expert perspectives for comprehensive analysis and decision-making.

### Sequential Role Chains

Process tasks through multiple expert roles in sequence, with each role building on the previous analysis.

#### Example: Feature Development Chain

```bash
claude
# Phase 1: Product Strategy
> /personal:roles:product-manager "Analyze user requirements for a real-time notification system"

# Phase 2: Technical Architecture (using output from Phase 1)
> /personal:roles:frontend-architect "Design technical architecture for real-time notifications based on: [previous output]"

# Phase 3: Implementation Quality (using outputs from Phases 1-2)
> /personal:roles:typescript-engineer "Define implementation standards and type safety for: [combined previous outputs]"

# Phase 4: Testing Strategy (using all previous outputs)
> /personal:roles:sdet "Create comprehensive testing strategy for: [all previous analysis]"
```

### Parallel Role Analysis

Get simultaneous input from multiple experts on the same problem.

#### Example: Code Review Team

**Set up parallel analysis commands:**

Create `.claude/commands/workflows/parallel-review.md`:

```markdown
# Parallel Code Review

Get simultaneous expert perspectives on code changes.

**Code to Review**: $ARGUMENTS

## Security Perspective
As a Cybersecurity Engineer, analyze: $ARGUMENTS
Focus on security vulnerabilities, authentication patterns, and data protection.

## Architecture Perspective  
As a Senior Frontend Architect, analyze: $ARGUMENTS
Focus on component design, performance, and scalability.

## Synthesis
Combine all three perspectives into unified recommendations with:
1. Priority rankings for identified issues
2. Conflicting recommendations resolved
3. Implementation roadmap
4. Quality gates for verification
```

### Context Handoff Between Roles

```

### 2. Error Handling
```bash
# Add error handling to scripts
set -e  # Exit on error

if ! command -v claude &> /dev/null; then
    echo "Claude Code not installed"
    exit 1
fi

if ! claude auth status &> /dev/null; then
    echo "Claude Code not authenticated"
    exit 1
fi
```

### 3. Logging and Monitoring
```bash
# Log workflow executions
LOG_FILE="~/.claude/workflow.log"
echo "$(date): Starting workflow: $WORKFLOW_NAME" >> $LOG_FILE

# Monitor execution time
START_TIME=$(date +%s)
# ... workflow execution ...
END_TIME=$(date +%s)
DURATION=$((END_TIME - START_TIME))
echo "Workflow completed in ${DURATION}s" >> $LOG_FILE
```

### 4. Version Control for Workflows
```bash
# Include workflows in version control
git add .claude/commands/
git add .github/workflows/
git commit -m "Add advanced Claude Code workflows"

# Tag workflow versions
git tag -a v1.0-workflows -m "Initial workflow release"
```
