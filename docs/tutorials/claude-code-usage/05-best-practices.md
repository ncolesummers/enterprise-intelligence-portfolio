# Best Practices

Optimize your Claude Code usage with proven strategies, community standards, and professional workflows.

## Memory Management Best Practices

### Project Memory (CLAUDE.md)

Create comprehensive project memory that helps Claude understand your codebase:

```markdown
# Project: Enterprise Intelligence Portfolio

This is a Next.js 15 portfolio website showcasing enterprise intelligence projects.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui following "new-york" style
- **Testing**: Playwright for comprehensive E2E testing
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript with strict mode

## Development Commands
- `pnpm dev` - Start development server with Turbopack
- `pnpm build` - Build production version
- `pnpm test:e2e` - Run Playwright E2E tests
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint
- `pnpm format` - Format code with Prettier

## Coding Standards
- Use TypeScript strict mode with proper type definitions
- Components are client-side by default (use 'use client')
- Follow shadcn/ui patterns with `cn()` utility for styling
- Implement comprehensive E2E testing with Playwright
- Maintain 100% test reliability with no flaky tests

## File Organization
- `src/app/` - Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- `src/components/` - Reusable React components
- `src/components/ui/` - shadcn/ui components
- `src/lib/` - Utility functions and configurations
- `tests/e2e/` - Playwright E2E tests

## Definition of Done
All code changes must meet the criteria in CLAUDE.md before completion.
```

### User Memory (~/.claude/CLAUDE.md)

```

## Effective Prompting Techniques

### 1. Be Specific and Contextual

```bash
# ❌ Vague request
claude -p "Fix this component"

# ✅ Specific request
claude -p "Fix the TypeScript error in src/components/ContactForm.tsx where the handleSubmit function is missing proper error handling for the FormSpree API call"
```

### 2. Provide Relevant Context

```bash
# ❌ No context
claude -p "How do I optimize performance?"

# ✅ With context
claude -p "How do I optimize the performance of the ProjectGrid component that renders 6 project cards with images? The component is causing unnecessary re-renders when the theme changes."
```

### 3. Use Progressive Disclosure

```bash
# Start broad, then get specific
claude
> Analyze the overall architecture of my contact form implementation
> [Review the response]
> Now focus specifically on the form validation strategy
> [Review the response]
> How can I improve the error handling for network failures?
```

### 4. Leverage Conversation History

```bash
# Continue related conversations
claude --continue
> Based on our previous discussion about the contact form, implement the improved error handling we designed
```

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Conversation Management

```bash
# Clear conversations regularly to maintain performance
claude
> /clear  # Clear when conversation gets too long

# Use --continue judiciously
claude --continue  # Only when context is truly needed
```

### 2. Efficient File Reading

```bash
# ✅ Mention specific files for targeted reading
claude -p "Review the validation logic in src/lib/validation.ts"

# ❌ Avoid asking to read entire codebases
claude -p "Review all my files"  # Too broad and inefficient
```

### 3. Batch Related Requests

```bash
# ✅ Combine related requests
claude -p "Review src/components/ContactForm.tsx for:
1. TypeScript type safety
2. Error handling patterns
3. Accessibility compliance
4. Performance optimizations"

# ❌ Multiple separate requests
# (Makes multiple requests for the same file)
```

## Team Collaboration Best Practices

### 1. Shared Command Standards

```markdown
# Team Command Naming Convention

## Format
/project:[category]:[action]

Examples:
- /project:review:component
- /project:generate:test
- /project:optimize:performance

## Categories
- review: Code review and analysis
- generate: Code and documentation generation
- optimize: Performance and quality improvements
- workflows: Multi-step processes
```

### 2. Documentation Standards

```markdown
# Command Documentation Template

## Purpose
Clear description of what the command does

## Usage
/project:command:name "description of input"

## Examples
/project:review:component "src/components/Button.tsx"

## Expected Output
- Specific feedback format
- Key areas of analysis
- Actionable recommendations

## Related Commands
- List complementary commands
- Workflow connections
```

### 3. Code Review Integration

```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Sensitive Data Protection

```bash
# ✅ Never include sensitive data in prompts
claude -p "Review the authentication logic structure (excluding actual keys)"

# ❌ Avoid exposing secrets
claude -p "Here's my API key: sk-xxx..."  # Never do this
```

### 2. Code Review Security

Create `.claude/commands/security/review.md`:

```markdown
# Security Review

Security-focused code review with data protection.

**Code to Review**: $ARGUMENTS

Review: $ARGUMENTS

## Security Analysis (excluding sensitive data)
1. Authentication/authorization patterns
2. Input validation and sanitization
3. Error handling and information disclosure
4. Dependency security
5. Configuration security

**Note**: Do not include actual API keys, secrets, or sensitive data in analysis.
```

### 3. Audit Trail

```bash
# Log security reviews
echo "$(date): Security review for $FILE" >> ~/.claude/security-reviews.log
```

## Quality Assurance

### 1. Testing Integration

```bash
# Generate tests for new features
claude -p "Create Playwright tests for the new contact form validation, covering:
1. Valid form submission
2. Required field validation
3. Email format validation
4. Network error handling
5. Success state display"

# Review test quality
claude -p "Review tests/e2e/contact-form.spec.ts for:
1. Test coverage completeness
2. Assertion quality
3. Test reliability and flakiness prevention
4. Edge case coverage"
```

### 2. Definition of Done Integration

Create `.claude/commands/quality/dod-check.md`:

```markdown
# Definition of Done Check

Verify code changes meet all Definition of Done criteria.

**Changes to Verify**: $ARGUMENTS

Check these changes against our Definition of Done: $ARGUMENTS

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. Command Not Working

```bash
# Check command file exists and is readable
ls -la .claude/commands/
cat .claude/commands/your-command.md

# Verify command syntax
claluclaude
> /project:your-command --help
```

### 2. Poor Response Quality

```bash
# Check project memory is loaded
claude
> /memory  # Verify CLAUDE.md content is appropriate

# Provide more context
> # Add relevant project context before asking
> This project uses Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
> [Then ask your question]
```

### 3. Authentication Issues

```bash
# Re-authenticate if needed
claude auth --logout
claude auth

# Check authentication status
claude auth status
```

### 4. Performance Issues

```bash
# Clear conversation history
claude
> /clear

# Use one-shot mode for simple requests
claude -p "quick question"

# Check for large file reads
# Avoid asking Claude to read massive files or entire codebases
```

## Advanced Optimization Techniques

### 1. Command Composition

```bash
# Chain commands with pipe (where appropriate)
echo "src/components/Button.tsx" | claude -p "Review this component file"

# Use command output as input to next command
COMPONENT_ANALYSIS=$(claude -p "Analyze Button component structure")
claude -p "Based on this analysis, suggest improvements: $COMPONENT_ANALYSIS"
```

### 2. Automated Workflows

Create `.claude/commands/workflows/daily-review.md`:

```markdown
# Daily Code Review Workflow

Systematic daily review of recent changes.

**Review Scope**: $ARGUMENTS

Daily review for: $ARGUMENTS

## Morning Review
1. **Recent Changes**: Review commits from last 24 hours
2. **Test Status**: Check test suite health
3. **Performance**: Monitor build and runtime performance
4. **Security**: Scan for potential security issues

## Quality Gates
- All tests passing
- No linting errors
- Build successful
- No security vulnerabilities

## Action Items
Generate prioritized list of:
- Critical issues requiring immediate attention
- Important improvements for today
