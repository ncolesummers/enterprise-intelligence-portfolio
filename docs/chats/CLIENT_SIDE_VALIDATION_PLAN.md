# Client-Side Form Validation Plan

**Created:** May 26, 2025  
**Status:** Planning Phase  
**Target:** Contact Form Enhancement

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to add comprehensive client-side validation to the contact form while maintaining the existing server-side validation and FormSpree integration.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Validation Infrastructure
1. **Shared validation schema** - Extract Zod schema from `actions.ts` to shared location
2. **Form state management** - Integrate React Hook Form for better form handling  
3. **Real-time field validation** - Field-level validation with immediate feedback

### Phase 2: User Experience Enhancements
4. **Visual error states** - Enhanced Input/Textarea components with error styling
5. **Debounced validation** - Prevent excessive validation during typing
6. **Form-level validation** - Pre-submission validation with clear error summary

### Phase 3: Testing & Accessibility
7. **E2E test updates** - Update Playwright tests for new validation behavior
8. **Accessibility testing** - Ensure screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation

## Key Features
- **Immediate feedback** on field blur/change
- **Progressive enhancement** - works without JS, enhanced with JS
- **Consistent styling** with existing shadcn/ui design system
- **Accessibility-first** approach with proper ARIA attributes
- **Performance optimized** with debouncing and efficient re-renders

## Technical Approach
- Reuse existing Zod schema for consistency
- Enhance current UI components rather than replace
- Maintain current FormSpree integration
- Follow established patterns from the codebase

## Estimated Timeline
**Total:** 4-7 hours across 3 phases

The implementation will provide immediate user feedback while maintaining the robust server-side validation already in place.
