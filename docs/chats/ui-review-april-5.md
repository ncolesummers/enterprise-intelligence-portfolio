Below is a set of requirements to address the issues identified in your mobile portfolio screenshot:

⸻

Header and Navigation
	•	Separation and Spacing:
	•	Ensure the name and “Work” elements are clearly separated with sufficient spacing.
	•	Increase padding around social icons (e.g., LinkedIn and GitHub) so they are not too close to each other or the screen edge.
	•	Navigation Clarity:
	•	Clarify the purpose of the floating “N” button by providing an accessible label or tooltip.
	•	Confirm that all interactive elements have a minimum tap target size for mobile usability.

⸻

Typography and Content Hierarchy
	•	Headline Structure:
	•	Create a clear visual hierarchy in the headline text.
	•	Break long headlines into multiple lines to improve readability and prevent overwhelming the user.
	•	Subtitle Visibility:
	•	Adjust the font size and weight of the subtitle to ensure it complements the headline without being overshadowed.

⸻

Call-to-Action Elements
	•	Button Visibility:
	•	Redesign the “Selected Projects” button to have a higher contrast against the background for better visibility and accessibility.
	•	Consider using clear visual cues (such as borders or shadows) to indicate interactivity.

⸻

Layout and Spacing
	•	Content Padding:
	•	Introduce consistent and responsive padding around the content to avoid elements touching the screen edges.
	•	Ensure that spacing adjustments maintain visual balance across different device sizes.
