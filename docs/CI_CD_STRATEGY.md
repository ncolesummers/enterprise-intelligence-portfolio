## Cost Management

### Budget Planning
**Monthly Costs: $50-150**
- Anthropic API: $20-100 (based on usage)
- GitHub Actions: Free tier sufficient
- Vercel Pro: $20/month (analytics included)
- FormSpree Pro: $10/month (if needed)

### Token Optimization Strategies
1. **Smart Caching**
   - Cache AI analysis results for unchanged files
   - Use git diff to analyze only modified code
   - Implement request deduplication

2. **Efficient Prompting**
   ```yaml
   # Optimized prompt structure
   custom_instructions: |
     FOCUS: Portfolio conversion optimization
     CONTEXT: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
     PRIORITY: Performance, accessibility, SEO
     OUTPUT: Specific, actionable recommendations only
   ```

3. **Usage Monitoring**
   - Track API usage through Anthropic dashboard
   - Set budget alerts at 75% and 90% thresholds
