# Component Refactoring Tasks

This document outlines the tasks required to address the UI review feedback and implement the necessary changes to improve the mobile and small screen portfolio experience.

## Header and Navigation

- [ ] Ensure the name and "Work" elements are clearly separated with sufficient spacing for mobile and small screens.
- [ ] Increase padding around social icons (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.) to avoid them being too close to each other or the screen edge on mobile devices.
- [ ] Add an accessible label or tooltip to the floating "N" button to clarify its purpose.
- [ ] Confirm all interactive elements meet the minimum tap target size for mobile usability.

## Typography and Content Hierarchy

- [ ] Create a clear visual hierarchy in the headline text for small screens.
- [ ] Break long headlines into multiple lines to improve readability and prevent overwhelming the user on mobile devices.
- [ ] Adjust the font size and weight of the subtitle to ensure it complements the headline without being overshadowed.

## Call-to-Action Elements

- [ ] Redesign the "Selected Projects" button to have a higher contrast against the background for better visibility and accessibility on small screens.
- [ ] Add clear visual cues (such as borders or shadows) to indicate button interactivity.

## Layout and Spacing

- [ ] Introduce consistent and responsive padding around the content to avoid elements touching the screen edges on mobile devices.
- [ ] Ensure spacing adjustments maintain visual balance across different device sizes.

## Final Review

- [ ] Review all updated pages for consistency and ensure no functionality was broken.
- [ ] Perform final cleanup and remove any unused code or styles.
