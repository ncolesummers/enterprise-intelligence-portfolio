# Component Refactoring Tasks

This document outlines the tasks required to address the UI review feedback and implement the necessary changes to improve the mobile and small screen portfolio experience.

## Header and Navigation

- [ ] **Convert Header Navigation to a Hamburger Menu**
  - **Desktop View**: Ensure the current navigation layout (links and buttons visible in a horizontal row) remains unchanged.
  - **Mobile View**:
    - Replace the navigation links with a hamburger menu icon.
    - Clicking the icon should toggle a dropdown menu with the navigation links.
  - **Implementation Steps**:
    1. Add a state variable using React's `useState` to manage the open/closed state of the hamburger menu.
    2. Add a hamburger menu button (`<button>`) that is visible only on smaller screens (`sm:hidden`).
    3. Hide the navigation links on smaller screens (`hidden sm:flex`).
    4. Create a dropdown menu (`<div>`) that appears when the hamburger menu is toggled.
    5. Style the dropdown menu with TailwindCSS (`absolute`, `bg-black`, `rounded`, etc.).
    6. Include all navigation links and buttons inside the dropdown.
    7. Add accessibility features:
       - Use `aria-expanded` on the hamburger button to indicate the menu state.
       - Add `aria-label` to the button for screen readers.
       - Ensure focus trapping within the dropdown when it is open.
    8. Add animations for smooth opening/closing using TailwindCSS classes like `transition`, `ease-in-out`, and `duration-300`.
    9. Ensure the dropdown menu closes when clicking outside of it.

## Final Review

- [ ] Review all updated pages for consistency and ensure no functionality was broken.
- [ ] Perform final cleanup and remove any unused code or styles.
